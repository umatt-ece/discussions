## Organization
Discussions are broken up into 2 major categories:

> **Public Discussions:** These discussions can viewed, modified, and posted by any user with a GitHub account - regardless of whether or not they are on the UMATT team. This a good way to provide information to and get input from those not part of our team. For example: students looking for info about UMATT, potential sponsors/employeers wanting to provide input on the projects we undertake, alumni looking to still provide advise and input to the team. Public discussions are broken up into 3 threads:
> 
> 1. _FAQs_
> 2. _General_
> 3. _Ideas_

> **Team Discussions:** These discussions are intended for team members only. Here, memebers can find team announcements, polls on various team/project issues, and weekly shop updates. Keep your eyes open for important _Announcements_, and regularly check the _Shop Talk_ thread for information on the current shop plan. Team discussions are broken up into 3 threads:
> 
> 1. _Announcements_
> 2. _Polls_
> 3. _Shop Talk_
